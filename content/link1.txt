"This is terrifying," he muttered his eyes transfixed on the stuffed models displayed against the pink wall. "Its showcase of trophy dogs."
<br><br>
"Don't say that," she laughed, running her hands over the golden fur of the Labrador dog next to her. "These are all the pets I've ever had .After they died I couldn"t bear to let them go, so I had a taxidermist preserve them for me. And here they are." Her out stretched arm swept the room's view
<br><br> 
He gaped at her, his throat dry, his feet fixed to the floor. He wanted to say something, he could feel the urge convulsing through him in jolts, as if he were being electrified. At last he managed a meek question "You've have had a lot of dogs, haven't you?"
<br><br>
"I've never been without one" she said leaning in towards him. "My father loved dogs too. 'Dogs are upright as a steeple, and much more loyal than people' he used to say." She giggled again.
<br><br>
He flashed a nervous smile at her. Her laugh amplified the current racing through him, or maybe it was her appearance -the messy dark hair, the magenta hue of her dress that matched the walls of the room as if asserting her feminine power .The colour burned into his eyes.
<br><br>
"Your father sounds like a smart man,"
<br>
"Well" she said, tapping the nose of the dog in front of her. "I don't know if he was right about dogs, but he was definitely right about people, especially himself."
<br>
"And how is that?"
<br>
"He left us when I was little; eloped with some artist and broke my mummy's heart."
<br><br>
"I am sorry," he whispered, although he was not sure if he meant it .He could feel nothing but the surge of electricity through his palpitating body .
<br><br>
"Oh it's alright." She beamed at him. "I don't think about all of that. I don't need to .I have my dogs to keep me company. Don't you think they are so much interesting than people?"
<br><br>
He tried nodding at her but he could sense his neck drawing back into his shoulders .He felt smaller and smaller, or it was she who was growing taller and more majestic with each passing moment .He could not tell he was too distracted by the shifting heat. It was as if someone had wrapped him in a thick, furry blanket. He wanted to ask her to adjust the room's temperature but he could not recognize his own voice. It sounded garbled and fierce, the words unintelligible. Instead he walked towards her and gently pawed her feet.
<br><br>
She picked him up and brought him closer to her face, so close that their noses almost touched.
<br>
"And now I have you. Aren't you adorable?"
