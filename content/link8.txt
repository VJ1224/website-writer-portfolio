She had always been too scared to throw things away. During that summer by the ocean, she filled the newly painted cabinets with crumpled up lists, half-scrawled letters, unread newspaper clippings and grocery bills. The house was empty enough, and she had the nagging feeling at the back of her mind that she would need them someday. Something would come up -- she would need a record of what she had done one morning, or the details of a local theft, or a reminder of what she had been telling someone about. It felt good to have it all there; for her the growing piles of paper were the relics of the time she had spent in the cramped house, anchoring her place in the passage of days she had lost count of.

There was nothing much for her to do. By the days she would walk down to the beach and listen to music of the ocean. She watched it rush to embrace the shoreline, only to have its foamy white arms turned away and fizzle out into the blue drift. Beaches were a study in eternal rejection, she decided. She felt like quite an authority on the topic. At night she would try to write, and when she failed she would squeeze her eyes shut and imagine herself somewhere far away, maybe back in the city, pouring coffee into a pair of identical mugs as the singing from the shower drifted into the kitchen. It was just as she had left it -- the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the cacophonic street, the mahogany table, the creamy walls. She saw the cracks that ran in rivulets across the kitchen counter, felt the spot behind the door where the floorboards were uneven. It wasn't just a picture in her mind. She was there, and so was he, just as much as he was here with her right now.

It had been her decision to move to this stupid seaside town. They had always talked about it, not concretely of course, but in the hazy reverie people fall into when they speak of travelling the world, or quitting their jobs to paint; the way both of them had spoken about everything during the better half of their marriage. Now when she put the broken pieces together, it made sense that he loved the ocean. The ocean had a capacity for forgiveness as vast and unwavering as its appetite. It would take whatever you gave it -- sand and debris and body -- and hide it under its jewel cover, unflinching, uncomplaining. But even the ocean had its rough days -- days of stormy skies and cloudy waters, of boats tossed around like a sulking child's toys, of roaring waves that threatened to tear apart the very coast they kissed. The refuse that had once been swallowed so softly was hurtled back, twisted and broken beyond recognition or repair. Those were the days she loved. She would amble along the edge of the rocky cliff while the wind tugged on her hair, threatening to pull her off if she took one wrong step. The smell of brine never left her house and she could always taste salt at the back of her throat.

The townsfolk thought she was crazy. She had heard what they said about her -- never talks to anyone, erratic behaviour, no real job, lives off her alimony. The truth was that the last she had seen of her husband was a white monogrammed envelope with a signed divorce agreement, posted from a five star hotel where the waiters knew them by name. She signed the papers, mailed them back, threw a jumble of books and clothes in a suitcase, and left the apartment. The first train tickets she found were to a small beach town known for its dwindling tourism industry. Her cottage had come with an off season discount and a landlady who was too new to the job to ask any questions. When she moved in, the sofas still had shiny plastic covers and her stomach churned at the smell of paint that lingered in the bedroom. It was three weeks before she unpacked; she loved to wander through the bare-walled rooms, to soak in the emptiness of sheets that had never been slept in, of crockery that did not know the warmth of food and touch.

She should not have tried to make herself feel at home. That was when she realised how empty it all was, the bric-a-brac she had brought with her -- possessions, once entirely hers, transformed into the souvenirs of cohabitation. They cluttered her life like ghosts, made permanent by their lack of substance.  Most of them were unnecessary. She could easily part with the copy of The Golden Notebook they had both read countless times, or the faded, holey t-shirt she wore as they curled up side by side under the heavy blankets they used all year round. But she had always been too scared to throw anything away. Who knew when she may need it again?
